GPS issues
~~~~~~~~~~
Some units (in particular Sprint-branded 595U) have GPS disabled in nvram
and/or firmware.  This may not be apparent immediately. The modem accepts GPS
commands, both AT and CnS, and spends some time searching for the signal.
The results is always FAIL.

Sierra Watcher can report this is some cases, showing GPS options as disabled,
though the build I have just segfaults when GPS button is pressed.

The hardware is still the same, but the only fix known (re-flashing the unit
with what Sierra tools see as incompatible firmware) is non-trivial,
so for most intents and purposes these units should be assumed to lack GPS.
