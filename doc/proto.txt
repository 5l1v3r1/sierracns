Sierra CnS protocol overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CnS messages are short one-packet datagrams. Each request is a CnS message,
and each modem reply is a CnS message.

The protocol is asynchronous. Requests are not acknowledged. Replies are in fact
status notifications, and modem may send them without a request. 
In most cases however, talking to modem is a simple
	request reply request reply request reply ...
sequence. For unrecognized requests, modem usually replies with an error notification.

Each CnS message has a 2-byte request code (called object id, or oid in the source)
determining what is being retrieved or set. Each packet may also carry variable-length
payload, usually containing the requested value.


Wire protocol: CnS/HIP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CnS messages are wrapped in HIP packets like this:

	HIP:  |mid|...|len|-------------------------------|
	CnS:              |oid|op|len|------payload-------|

HIP is a basic packet protocol with start/stop bytes and character escaping
(running over emulated serial link over inherently packet-based USB, yep).

Bare HIP is used for firmware flashing, but everything else is done
with CnS packets carried by HIP packets.

The mid (message id) field in HIP, just like oid field in CnS packet, determines
the kind of payload the packet carries. Two particular mids, 0x2B and 0x6B, mean
the payload is in fact a CnS packet, to and from modem respectively.

Both HIP and CnS packets have length field. Sometimes modem replies with a HIP
packet that's slighly larger than the CnS packet inside, but that seems to be
address alignment or something like that.


CnS objects
~~~~~~~~~~~
The oid field determines the structure and meaning of the payload... well, no,
not really. For any given modem it does apparently, but different modems may
reply with different data for the same oid. Or differently-structured data with
the same meaning.

Anyway, oid is the only clear way to identify the contents of the packet.
The tool also checks for the packet length, but it's clearly not reliable.

For some oids, the data start with a two-byte version field.
For others, it doesn't.
Anyway, even matching version does not guarantee anything.


Error handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Invalid HIP packets are discarded. For invalid CnS requests, modem returns
free-form error message (a string) in a reply packet with error bit set.
The messages my modem produces start with "errN", N being error code.
