Undocumented requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some requests I have no documentation for, but somehow find kinda promising.
All tried on MC5725.

Generally modem replies with "err2:invalid object id" if the oid is out of range,
and "err4:invalid length" if get requests needs some data.

The meaning of "err3:invalid operation type" and "err6:invalid request" is not clear.
In some cases (0F0B) "invalid request" is issued because it only allows notifications,
not get requests.

Most oids ignore request payload with no error messages.

4015:aaaa -> { S:a B:b (8 bytes of data) B:c S:z }
accepts any two-byte "address", repeats it together with 12 bytes of data.
In most cases b and c are zero, but a=0000 and a=0001 produces b=01
while a=0002 gives c=6D. The meaning of z is not clear.
Only a=0000...0014 return non-zero data.

1037:0000 -> { S:0 (8 zero bytes) }
1037:0001 -> { S:1 (8 zero bytes) }

1038:000X -> { S:X S:l string(l) S S B }
only X=0 and X=1 are allowed, l=10 in both cases and the string is numeric.
X=0 produces the same string as 1002 with no payload

4018 returns "2.0" (a string). Same as 0003, so chances are it's HW version.

1033 returns "err11:Bad NV read". Hm.

FFFF reboots modem (even a GET request!)

0F01=000000000000
start something gps-related. Returns reply similar to 0F04.

0F03 seems to be AT!GPSSTATUS data. Not documented.

0F14 { S:1 S:x } == AT!GPSLOCK=x
(the first short is apparently request version)

7000 any SET request accepted; payload ignored. Same with 7001.
7002, 7003 â€” notifications only

1044:0000, 1044:0001 (other payloads rejected). Both return 3 shorts.

1033:00140000 -> { 00 14 00 00 01 1B 01 80 }
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~ ^^^^^ ^^^^^
                   address     Pri.A Pri.B  channel
1033:00150000 -> { 00 15 00 00 02 B3 03 09 }
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~ ^^^^^ ^^^^^
                   address     Sec.A Sec.B  channel
