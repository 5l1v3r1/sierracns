CnS caveats
~~~~~~~~~~~
These are short notes describing some rought corners I've ran into.
May be useful for those trying to extend sierracns.
(at least you'll have some idea of what kind of troubles to expect)


OIDs mess
~~~~~~~~~
There's a significant difference between documented behavior and what
is observed with the actual device in hand. The problem is, the device I have
is an older CDMA unit while most of the documentation concerns relatively
recent UMTS models.

According to documentation, there are three large groups of oids: common,
UMTS-specific and CDMA-specific, which makes a lot of sense.
It's natural to assume the difference is solely due to
my device being CDMA card and not UMTS, and that all UMTS units should
work more or less the same way and that the same goes for all CDMA units.

However, this may not be the case, and it looks like the protocol is much
more messy than it should be. Aside from apparent UMTS/CDMA group overlaps,
my MC5725 card uses different data formats than what's described for MC5725
with a newer firmware.

There is no simple way to tell which version is being used, or in fact which
standard the modem operates in. There's 000A request, but it's listed
as "deprecated" for newer modems. And while it does contain CDMA/UTMS flag,
my modem returns 0 which is (no-value) instead.


Truncated responses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Documented responses for my particular model with newer FW version
are longer and contain more data. Aforementioned 000A in paricular
should have the name of the modem, as text. MC5725 only returns 4 bytes,
numeric model code and 0 instead of supported standard.


Incomplete documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Document specifically describing MC5725 lists 11 requests labelled
"... all CnS messages supported by ... MC5725 ..."

In reality, MC5725 modem accepts something like 120 oids at least,
plus about 50 more are apparently valid but require something
other than a simple get operation to get non-error response.

The reasons for omission are completely unclear, as the list excludes
purely informative 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004 apparently supported by all
units, CDMA and UMTS. Among skipped requests is also 1032 which clearly
returns current time.


Incompatible OIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are OIDs from UMTS docs for which my MC5725 returns something
clearly not fitting the description. Take a look if you're implementing
one of these oids to avoid nasty surprises.

               len      description     MC5725 reply
1004		15	IMSI		{ 03 F5 }
1067		15	IMEI		{ 00 54 }
1063		 1	Model code	{ 00 00 80 00 }
1011		 1	Disable		{ 00 00 } (maybe just short instead of byte?)
1072		 8	Emergency numbers	only accepts ND (but not NE!)

CnS address space is 2**16, of which about 0.2% tops is used for any particular unit.
How did Sierra manage to come up with overlapping oids for CDMA and UMTS is beyond me.


GET vs NOTIFICATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In most cases (well at least in all documented cases) get reply and notification have
exactly the same payload format. There is however at least one exception: 3011 notifies
about number being called but returns something apparently unrelated for a GET request.
